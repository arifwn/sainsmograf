Hi! My name is Arif Widi Nugroho. I love doing software development with all kind of tech (frontend, backend, deployment and a bit of maintenance). I'm probably fallen into that category called "Full Stack" developer.

I do consulting for general software development (desktop and server app), web development, and occasional mobile app development. I'm based in Bandung (Indonesia) and available remotely. Ping me at [arif@sainsmograf.com](mailto:arif@sainsmograf.com), I'd love to chat sometimes :).
